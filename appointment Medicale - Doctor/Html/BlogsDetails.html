            <div><h1>How to properly use a covid self-test?</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Why use a covid self-test? To protect ourselves and our loved
                ones, this rapid test significantly reduces the risk of
                transmission and infection by the covid virus. Practical , quick
                and easy to use , this medical device helps promote screening.
                Carrying out the self-test consists of detecting the presence of
                antigens on the surface of the virus . The presence of
                coronavirus DNA demonstrated by this rapid screening test then
                confirms that the person tested is truly infected. This is a
                nasal swab method and not a blood test. It complies with the
                requirements of the high health authority . This antigen test
                complements RT-PCR tests which remain the only reference
                diagnostic tools. Who can do the self-tests? Performing a test
                to detect covid is now accessible to everyone . In fact, you can
                benefit from voluntary screening by purchasing a self-test box
                without the intervention of a health professional . The
                self-test makes it possible to detect covid in people aged over
                15 , who are asymptomatic and are not contact cases . The
                frequency of sampling is very important. They must be carried
                out regularly, at least 1 to 2 times a week. This frequency
                ensures early viral detection, making it easier to handle .
                Symptomatic people do not need to use a self-test . People at
                risk such as pregnant women or cancer patients should contact
                their doctor immediately if they develop symptoms . For these
                cases, referral to a PCR or blood test is prescribed. How to use
                the covid self-test? The covid self-test does not require a
                blood test or saliva test . It is done by nasal swab . The
                composition of the kit varies depending on the self-tests. You
                can have additional information on this covid self-test box .
                Before carrying out the test, you should disinfect your hands
                thoroughly : either by washing with soap and water, or by using
                a hydroalcoholic gel . This helps eliminate bacteria and viruses
                and reduces any risk of contamination . Once your hands have
                been disinfected, you can carry out the screening operation:
                Unpack all items from the self-test kit on a sanitized surface
                Read the user manual carefully to understand the usefulness of
                each element of the kit Carefully open the package containing
                the swab and remove the cassette from its packaging Insert the
                swab into your nostril 2 to 3 cm Rub lightly using a rotating
                motion with the swab Remove the swab to wring it in the solution
                for 10 seconds Place the dropper nipple on the tube Pour 4 drops
                of the mixture onto the well of the cassette Wait about 10 to 15
                minutes to obtain the result . The detection time varies
                according to the manufacturer's instructions. Please note that
                the screening procedure may differ depending on the types of
                self-test you choose. It is therefore very important to read the
                instructions carefully, as they may vary depending on the
                specificity of the test. If in doubt, do not hesitate to contact
                your pharmacist. How to interpret the self-test result? The
                instructions included in the kit provide the details necessary
                to interpret the self-test . The element used to display the
                result has 2 lines of controls : A C control line A T control
                line. The positivity or negativity of the test will depend on
                the numbers of colored bands that appear on these lines. This
                screening device is similar to pregnancy tests . The test result
                is POSITIVE if two colored bands appear in zones C and T. The
                test result is NEGATIVE if a single colored band appears in zone
                C. The test result is INVALID if no bands appear . In this case,
                you must repeat the test again, following the instructions
                exactly. SAYAH, [2/24/2024 10:07 AM] What if the test result is
                positive? If the person screened tests positive, isolation is
                required and takes effect immediately . You must also warn your
                contacts to avoid spreading the virus . This positive result
                must be confirmed by having yourself tested without delay at a
                screening center , in a pharmacy or in analysis laboratories .
                After confirmation by a nasopharyngeal PCR test , Health
                Insurance will contact the people to whom you may have
                transmitted the virus . These people can in turn be tested in
                order to prevent the spread of the virus . For severe forms,
                patients must be taken to hospitals or emergency rooms. During
                isolation , your attending physician will provide your medical
                care. He will prescribe medications to reduce and suppress the
                viral load. You have to be careful, because self-tests remain
                rapid tests and the risk of having a false negative is high. On
                the other hand, false positive results are rare . For the
                negative test, it is always better to repeat the samples
                regularly with the right actions. Whether you test positive or
                negative, respecting barrier gestures and strict health measures
                is always required to fight this virus. In any case, the
                information centers can provide you with more details on the
                tests available

              <p>
                What is a stethoscope used for ? The stethoscope is a piece of
                medical diagnostic equipment used by healthcare professionals to
                auscultate a patient. Its principle is based on the transmission
                and amplification of sound waves by resonance. Medical equipment
                then makes it possible to listen to the sounds produced by the
                body: So-called high frequency noises are normal physiological
                noises; So-called low frequency noises are abnormal or
                pathological noises. Depending on the pathology and the part of
                the body to be auscultated, the healthcare professional uses
                different types of medical stethoscopes: Cardiology stethoscope
                It is a medical diagnostic tool specially designed to detect
                different cardiac pathologies such as heart failure and heart
                rhythm disorders. Pinard stethoscope This type of medial
                stethoscope is made mainly of wood or aluminum. Its use is
                reserved for listening to the heartbeat of the fetus in the
                uterus. Electronic stethoscope The electronic stethoscope is
                tangible proof of the perpetual development of technology. The
                medical device ensures optimal amplification of sounds and helps
                reduce external noise. Its high performance allows it to isolate
                specific noises. Its use becomes easier, due to the existence of
                an LCD screen. The latter displays auscultation data like the
                patient's heart rate. Newer models have a sound recorder so you
                can listen to them again and share them. These recordings help
                specialists analyze in detail the nature of the noises perceived
                for an accurate diagnosis. What is a stethoscope made of?
                Stethoscopes come in standard shapes. Generally speaking, they
                are made up of the following elements: The lyre This is the
                metal part propagating the sound from the tubing to the GP's
                ear. Its oriented shape adapts perfectly to the hearing system
                of each user. The tubing This flexible plastic part allows the
                sound to be transmitted from the bell to the lyre. It can be
                single or double. A single tube divides the signal at the Y pass
                while the double tube transmits internal noise in stereo mode.
                This prevents any propagation of noise in favor of closer
                monitoring of the heart rate. Ear tips They are inserted into
                the doctor's ears to isolate them from ambient noise. The more
                flexible they are, the more comfort they provide. Add to this
                better sealing as well as a long lifespan. Pavilion This is the
                block to be placed on the patient's body during auscultation.
                The stethoscope can be single or double head. The small horn
                allows you to listen to low frequency sounds. Conversely, the
                large horn ensures that high frequency sounds can be heard. The
                membrane The pavilion is made of membranes. It represents the
                receiver of the stethoscope and is used to capture the sound
                vibrations emitted by the human body. It is available in single
                and dual frequency. The latter has the advantage of versatility.
                It provides its user with high frequency sounds like breathing
                as well as low frequency sounds like pops and heart rates. The
                shape of this membrane plays an important role in the
                performance of medical equipment. In this sense, an ovoid
                membrane makes it possible to auscultate parts that are
                difficult to access. Please note: each element of the
                stethoscope influences the performance of the equipment,
                particularly the acoustic quality. Guide to using a stethoscope
                As the stethoscope is medical equipment reserved for healthcare
                professionals, its use requires specific skills at the risk of
                distorting the diagnosis. During auscultation, the doctor or
                nurse places the flag on the part of the body subject to the
                medical examination. This depends on the type of pathology to be
                diagnosed:

            <div><h1>How to do calf strapping?</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                When and why should the calf be strapped? Generally speaking,
                calf strapping is indicated for the following situations:
                Contractures This type of trauma is caused by the strain on a
                tired muscle . Its treatment requires stopping physical efforts
                in favor of plenty of rest. Calf strapping contributes to the
                temporary relief of the affected muscle and limits its
                progression towards muscle elongation or tearing . Elongations
                This is a muscle injury due to excessive use of the triceps
                surae and lack of training before practicing sports. It results
                in inflammation of muscle fibers. Rest, cold treatment and
                ointment are the main treatments provided. The application of a
                strapping strip allows you to compress the muscle and prevent
                the formation of a possible intramuscular hematoma. Muscle tears
                Also called muscle strain, this trauma is linked to the rupture
                of part of the muscle fibers. This is followed by intense and
                immediate pain requiring the cessation of movement. Muscle tear
                occurs after brutal physical effort, shock, or even the
                athlete's lack of hydration. Strapping is added to his
                treatment, consisting of cryotherapy, elevation of the limb,
                physiotherapy sessions and taking painkillers. Find Urgo brand
                strapping bands on our website as well as cohesive elastic bands
                to carry out your strapping with quality products. The stages of
                calf strapping Calf strapping is an injury care and prevention
                technique requiring the use of medical bandages with flexible
                support. The application steps vary depending on the strapping
                method. Emergency strapping Wrap a fully taut cohesive bandage
                over the lower calf. Then, add a second bandage so that it half
                covers the first. Double pass over the affected area. Hold
                everything together using adhesive tape or a plaster.
                Counter-pressure strapping Wrap the entire calf muscle with a
                cohesive bandage stretched 70%, going around the injured area
                for more pressure once the second bandage is in place. Apply a
                non-elastic adhesive base around and on the injury and hold
                everything together with adhesive tape. Limiting strapping With
                the knee slightly bent, apply an elastic adhesive strip, without
                tension, to the base of the lower thigh. Place a second base on
                the triceps, followed by two slightly stretched bands on the
                back of the flexion-extension axis. Put the bandage in place
                with counter pressure and close the base and the top of the
                bandage with a stretchable adhesive strip. Alternatives to calf
                strapping Unless you strap the calf in the event of trauma,
                applying an elastic K-tape kinesiology tape is an alternative
                solution. This technique helps reduce contracture and prevent
                injuries. For the sake of efficiency, the taping must be carried
                out following the Kenzo Kase technique: Cut the ends of the
                strip to obtain a rounded shape; Apply the tape without tension
                on half of the sole of the foot held at 90°; Continue the
                bandage up to mid-calf at the level of the gastrocnemius muscle
                with a tension of 50%; Add another tap at the heel; Stick the
                stretch band on the left part of the leg up to mid-calf,
                stretching it; Repeat the operation on the right part of the
                leg.

                In 2019, the French manufacturer SPENGLER presented its new
                collection of stethoscopes with an ambitious promise, to offer
                the best acoustics in each category of stethoscope! At Le Pro du
                Médical, we tell you more about SPENGLER and its stethoscopes. A
                unique know-how in the world! When we mention the SPENGLER
                brand, we immediately think of the blood pressure monitor.
                Indeed, the French brand is known and recognized for its blood
                pressure monitors, nothing unusual, Émile SPENGLER having
                invented this instrument in 1907 with cardiologists Henri Vaquez
                and Charles Laubry. But what we know less is that by inventing
                the blood pressure monitor, they invented an inseparable couple
                blood pressure monitor and stethoscope. An essential pair for
                measuring blood pressure, the stethoscope being necessary to
                listen to Korotkoffs sounds. Consequently, the French
                manufacturer has unique experience in the design and
                manufacturing of stethoscopes with more than a century of
                know-how! The association of talents. To develop these
                stethoscopes, the French manufacturer surrounded itself with
                what it does best with the CENTRALE school in Marseille and the
                CNRS acoustics laboratory, which is the largest acoustics
                laboratory in Europe. and a global acoustics research center.
                Together, they studied over a radio range of 0 to 1,400 Hz
                (range corresponding to the medical examination) all the
                components of the stethoscopes. Each part, each material, each
                evolution was measured using new means with the aim of pushing
                the limits of our knowledge and making new design decisions.
                “The initial idea of the project was to design the best possible
                stethoscopes and for this we were ready to question our
                certainties and our beliefs. » Nicolas Lachaux, marketing
                manager A stethoscope for every professional! The new collection
                of stethoscopes is presented in 3 ranges, each with specific

                What type of examination glove to choose? Posted the:Mar 17,
                2022 | Author:CR The medical examination glove is one of the
                most coveted pieces of medical protective equipment. This
                accessory is a must-have for healthcare professionals and other
                operating specialists. Wearing gloves guarantees protection
                against the risks of infection and cross-contamination.
                Therefore, before any treatment, staff must put on gloves . All
                medical gloves are single-use to guarantee better hygiene.
                Generally, pairs of gloves are ambidextrous. There are also
                powdered gloves and powder-free gloves . The choice of
                examination gloves should not be made lightly. Several
                parameters must be taken into account: the medical procedure
                that will be performed, the choice of glove size , the risk of
                allergy, the intended use, comfort and resistance. The
                advantages of the Latex Glove : Latex gloves are the most used
                and the No. 1 examination gloves. Thanks to their thinness, the
                latex glove guarantees a superior feeling of comfort for both
                the staff and the patient during the medical examination. Highly
                recommended, it offers: - Better grip with better quality of
                touch thanks to the thin thickness of the material. - High
                sensitivity for better contact during delicate movements. -
                Optimal protection because it is very resistant to chemicals and
                perforations for patients and staff. - Excellent elasticity.
                However, some practitioners are allergic to certain components
                of this product and therefore cannot wear them. LPM recommends
                the Black Latex Glove , Dragon Skinz, available in XS – S – M –
                L – XL. The advantages of the Nitrile Glove : The disposable
                nitrile glove is the solution in case of allergies to natural
                latex. Made from synthetic rubber, its composition guarantees
                the same properties as latex gloves, namely: - Optimal
                resistance to cuts and tears. - Good grip with excellent sense
                of touch. - Excellent protection against chemicals and
                infections thanks to the long cuffs. - Very good elasticity. It
                should be noted that in the event of a perforation, the glove
                tears completely to prevent leaks. It must be changed. LPM
                recommends the Blue Nitrile Glove , Nacatur, available in S – M
                – L – XL. But also our Black Nitrile Gloves , Nitriskin LCH,
                available in S – M – L – XL. The advantages of the Vinyl Glove :
                The vinyl glove is another possible alternative to latex which
                is also more economical. This glove is one of the essentials in
                the medical environment. These hypoallergenic components allow
                all employees. He offers : - Good protection against chemicals
                and infections. - Good resistance to cuts, punctures and tears.
                - Excellent comfort for the caregiver and patient thanks to its
                components. In addition, its use is multiple: - Medical exams. -
                Foodstuffs. - Pet company. LPM recommends the Sensinyl LCH Vinyl
                Gloves , available in S – M – L. Advantages of the Sterile Glove
                : Among the gloves used by healthcare personnel, we find sterile
                gloves which are intended to protect the patient. These gloves
                are used for so-called sterile and invasive care (urinary
                catheterization) with a requirement for asepsis but also for
                short-term interventions (surgical suture). In fact, these are
                the only gloves capable of providing optimal asepsis. They offer
                : - Perfect dye sealing. - Optimal tactile sensitivity. - A high
                level of tensile strength. - An optimal bacteriological barrier.
                - Excellent elasticity. It is advisable to put on only one
                sterile glove so that one hand is aseptic and the other is not.
                It is advisable to only touch aseptic elements when wearing this
                device , but also to change gloves between each treatment, each
                patient and at each interruption for better protection. These
                gloves are available in powdered and powder-free versions and in
                disposable and reusable versions with long or short cuffs.
                SAYAH, [2/24/2024 10:19 AM] The difference between powdered and
                powder-free gloves. The powdered glove (corn starch) makes it
                easier to put on , promotes sliding between the glove and the
                skin, limits hand perspiration allowing the gloves to be worn
                for longer. Conversely, non-powdered ones were created for
                people allergic to powder. During use, these gloves offer an
                undeniable feeling of comfort. What is the difference between
                nitrile vinyl latex? The differences are based on 3 criteria:
                protection capacity, resistance to perforations and chemicals
                and use. It is important to choose the right glove for the right
                use to guarantee optimal protection.

                How to measure your blood pressure Posted the:Nov 5, 2021 |
                Auteur: Regular blood pressure monitoring is strongly
                recommended for people prone to hypertension for better
                monitoring. Moreover, the blood pressure monitor is no longer
                reserved only for healthcare personnel. It is aimed at the
                general public wishing to measure their blood pressure at home.
                What is blood pressure? Blood pressure, known by the acronym TA,
                refers to the pressure that blood exerts on the walls of the
                arteries. It is measured using an electronic device designed for
                this purpose. There are two types : The blood pressure monitor
                This is the iconic blood pressure measuring device. It is used
                in medical offices by healthcare professionals, particularly
                doctors and nurses, but also at home for self-measurement. The
                ambulatory blood pressure measuring device (MAPA) It is the most
                popular tool for measuring blood pressure at home and during
                travel. It automatically measures blood pressure at regular
                intervals day and night. On the other hand, you have to wear it
                constantly. Why take your blood pressure at home ? The
                healthcare professional prescribes self-measurement of blood
                pressure for the following reasons: Monitoring the variation in
                blood pressure with a view to diagnosing hypertension; Regular
                blood pressure measurement to check the effectiveness of
                antihypertensive treatment. Thanks to this arrangement, the
                patient will be kept informed of their blood pressure throughout
                the day without having to travel. If there is a problem, he will
                send the result to the attending physician for analysis.
                Furthermore, the white coat effect will be ruled out in order to
                prevent diagnostic error. For its part, ambulatory blood
                pressure measurement (ABPM) makes it possible to study blood
                pressure variations throughout the day, while carrying out usual
                tasks. Which device to carry out a self-measurement? For the
                sake of measurement precision and reliability, opt for an
                electronic upper arm blood pressure monitor. This saves you from
                the risk of positioning errors which are common with wrist blood
                pressure monitors. In addition, this type of device is equipped
                with an adjustable cuff to the size of your arm. If you are
                looking for a simple device to take your blood pressure and
                nothing more, the VAQUEZ -LAUBRY Classic Spengler cuff blood
                pressure monitor model is perfect for you. On the other hand, if
                your doctor suggests a tool with a heart rate measurement
                option, the OMRON RS4 electronic wrist blood pressure monitor
                should be preferred. You can also turn to the OMRON M6 Comfort
                Electronic Upper Arm Blood Pressure Monitor which has a data
                storage memory. Either way, you can seek advice from your doctor
                or online store. How to take your blood pressure? To carry out
                self-measurement of blood pressure, you must respect the “rule
                of 3”. This involves measuring blood pressure 3 times in a row
                every 2 minutes twice a day: In the morning before meals and
                taking medication; In the evening before going to bed. Repeat
                these actions for 3 days, respecting the following conditions:
                Sit comfortably in a chair and remain calm for 5 minutes;
                Position the arm slightly bent while resting on the table, the
                elbow at heart level; Place the cuff on the bare arm following
                the indicated threading direction; Turn on the device and wait
                for the cuff to inflate and deflate automatically. Once the
                voltage is taken, the device displays two values ​​through its
                LCD screen. Expressed in millimeters of mercury, these
                correspond to systolic blood pressure (the highest) and
                diastolic blood pressure. In the absence of an integrated
                memory, keep these values ​​in a notebook with the date and time
                of the measurement. Send the 18 measurements taken over 3 days
                to the attending physician to determine your average blood
                pressure. For ambulatory measurement, the device is set up in
                the cardiologist's office. The device takes and records blood
                pressures automatically. Take note of the activities carried out
                during the day and the time at which you carried them out (or
                the time of taking medication if applicable). Also pay attention
                to the symptoms you experience: shortness of breath, pain, etc.

                How to do ankle strapping? Posted the:Oct 15, 2021 |
                Author:Corentin Barelle By taking a false step on uneven ground
                or while playing sports, the ankle can twist. This injury is
                treated by strapping, regardless of its severity. It is a
                physiotherapy technique with analgesic and curative purposes for
                sprained ankles. You still have to install it correctly. The
                different types of ankle sprains An ankle sprain results in the
                stretching and/or rupture of the ligaments due to shocks or
                sudden twists of the joint. It often occurs after a fall or
                while playing sports. Depending on the bundles and ligaments
                subject to twisting, there are two types of sprains : The
                external sprain This type of sprain represents 85% of cases. It
                is caused by an inversion movement; that is, the foot trips
                inward while the leg goes outward. The external lateral ligament
                sprain includes three stages of severity depending on the damage
                to the ligaments: Benign sprain : distension of a bundle of the
                external lateral ligament without tearing or tearing; Medium
                sprain : tearing of a bundle of the lateral collateral ligament
                and stretching of another bundle; Serious sprain : total rupture
                of several bundles of the external lateral ligament causing
                immediate and violent pain. Internal sprain Sprain of the medial
                lateral ligament or tibiofibular ligaments rarely occurs. It is
                characterized by a forced eversion movement of the foot. Unlike
                an external sprain, the foot comes out when the leg comes in.
                The injury can involve multiple ankle ligaments or even bone
                fractures. To reduce the pain and contribute to the
                rehabilitation of a sprained ankle , the application of a
                bandage is necessary . In this context, strapping presents
                itself as an effective solution. It offers flexible support at
                the level of the joint concerned thanks to the fabric strips.
                Our useful products for good strapping: - Urgostrapping :
                strapping band that lets the skin breathe and holds it securely.
                - NYLEXOGRIP : cohesive elastic band to secure your strapping
                for optimal support - Simple stretch band : the essential
                accessory in your first aid kits The stages of ankle strapping
                The effectiveness of ankle strapping depends on the way it is
                applied and the material used. Here are the steps for good ankle
                strapping, the installation is done in 4 steps: Place the
                strapping strip Wrap the affected limb with a protective bandage
                extending from the foot to a third of the calf. Shaving is
                necessary before strapping to ensure comfort and stickiness. It
                is also possible to use a protective film to fix the strips and
                prevent skin risks. Ankle strapping Apply headers The ankle
                strapping starts from the first third of the lower calf, at the
                level of the musculotendinous junction of the triceps. Place a
                base around the leg, keeping 30 cm of the band for fixing the
                foot. Although optional, a second base at the instep allows for
                semi-rigid strapping. Ankle strapping to maintain Install the
                caliper and ring With the foot held at 90°, apply the stirrup by
                pulling on the elastic band. The grip is at the heel level and
                goes up to the calf, passing through each side of the calf base.
                From there, stretch the band toward the hollow of the foot in a
                figure eight. You are free to double the stirrup and the ring
                using a non-elastic band for more support. Secure the assembly
                with the remaining 30 cm of the calf base bandage. Ankle strap
                attachment Move on to finishing Wrap an elastic adhesive strip ,
                such as protective Nylexogrip , around the heel without
                straining the Achilles tendon. Then, use rigid bands to further
                strap the fibula joint starting from the base of the foot. The
                strip in question must cover 2/3 of the area concerned. To
                finish, apply a stretchy strip 6 or 8 cm wide to cover
                everything. The installation is done from top to bottom and
                without tension. Make sure there are no crisscrosses or folds.

            <div><h1>How to properly use a covid self-test?</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Why use a covid self-test? To protect ourselves and our loved
                ones, this rapid test significantly reduces the risk of
                transmission and infection by the covid virus. Practical , quick
                and easy to use , this medical device helps promote screening.
                Carrying out the self-test consists of detecting the presence of
                antigens on the surface of the virus . The presence of
                coronavirus DNA demonstrated by this rapid screening test then
                confirms that the person tested is truly infected. This is a
                nasal swab method and not a blood test. It complies with the
                requirements of the high health authority . This antigen test
                complements RT-PCR tests which remain the only reference
                diagnostic tools. Who can do the self-tests? Performing a test
                to detect covid is now accessible to everyone . In fact, you can
                benefit from voluntary screening by purchasing a self-test box
                without the intervention of a health professional . The
                self-test makes it possible to detect covid in people aged over
                15 , who are asymptomatic and are not contact cases . The
                frequency of sampling is very important. They must be carried
                out regularly, at least 1 to 2 times a week. This frequency
                ensures early viral detection, making it easier to handle .
                Symptomatic people do not need to use a self-test . People at
                risk such as pregnant women or cancer patients should contact
                their doctor immediately if they develop symptoms . For these
                cases, referral to a PCR or blood test is prescribed. How to use
                the covid self-test? The covid self-test does not require a
                blood test or saliva test . It is done by nasal swab . The
                composition of the kit varies depending on the self-tests. You
                can have additional information on this covid self-test box .
                Before carrying out the test, you should disinfect your hands
                thoroughly : either by washing with soap and water, or by using
                a hydroalcoholic gel . This helps eliminate bacteria and viruses
                and reduces any risk of contamination . Once your hands have
                been disinfected, you can carry out the screening operation:
                Unpack all items from the self-test kit on a sanitized surface
                Read the user manual carefully to understand the usefulness of
                each element of the kit Carefully open the package containing
                the swab and remove the cassette from its packaging Insert the
                swab into your nostril 2 to 3 cm Rub lightly using a rotating
                motion with the swab Remove the swab to wring it in the solution
                for 10 seconds Place the dropper nipple on the tube Pour 4 drops
                of the mixture onto the well of the cassette Wait about 10 to 15
                minutes to obtain the result . The detection time varies
                according to the manufacturer's instructions. Please note that
                the screening procedure may differ depending on the types of
                self-test you choose. It is therefore very important to read the
                instructions carefully, as they may vary depending on the
                specificity of the test. If in doubt, do not hesitate to contact
                your pharmacist. How to interpret the self-test result? The
                instructions included in the kit provide the details necessary
                to interpret the self-test . The element used to display the
                result has 2 lines of controls : A C control line A T control
                line. The positivity or negativity of the test will depend on
                the numbers of colored bands that appear on these lines. This
                screening device is similar to pregnancy tests . The test result
                is POSITIVE if two colored bands appear in zones C and T. The
                test result is NEGATIVE if a single colored band appears in zone
                C. The test result is INVALID if no bands appear . In this case,
                you must repeat the test again, following the instructions
                exactly. SAYAH, [2/24/2024 10:07 AM] What if the test result is
                positive? If the person screened tests positive, isolation is
                required and takes effect immediately . You must also warn your
                contacts to avoid spreading the virus . This positive result
                must be confirmed by having yourself tested without delay at a
                screening center , in a pharmacy or in analysis laboratories .
                After confirmation by a nasopharyngeal PCR test , Health
                Insurance will contact the people to whom you may have
                transmitted the virus . These people can in turn be tested in
                order to prevent the spread of the virus . For severe forms,
                patients must be taken to hospitals or emergency rooms. During
                isolation , your attending physician will provide your medical
                care. He will prescribe medications to reduce and suppress the
                viral load. You have to be careful, because self-tests remain
                rapid tests and the risk of having a false negative is high. On
                the other hand, false positive results are rare . For the
                negative test, it is always better to repeat the samples
                regularly with the right actions. Whether you test positive or
                negative, respecting barrier gestures and strict health measures
                is always required to fight this virus. In any case, the
                information centers can provide you with more details on the
                tests available

                How to get reimbursed for medical equipment from your mutual
                insurance company? Posted the:Dec 8, 2020 | Auteur: Depending on
                the illness , the doctor may be required to prescribe possible
                medical equipment to the patient , in addition to medications .
                As an integral part of the elements of care , they are eligible
                for coverage by mutual health insurance and Social Security
                under conditions. Social Security reimbursement conditions
                Social Security reimburses part of the costs incurred by medical
                equipment if it is the subject of a medical prescription by the
                patient's specialist or treating physician . This only concerns
                medical devices belonging to the list of reimbursable products
                and services (LPPR or LPP) . For reimbursement to take place, a
                request for prior agreement is required. This process involves
                filling out a form to be contacted by the attending physician or
                specialist . Once the document is completed, it must be sent to
                the medical service of the Primary Health Insurance Fund with
                the medical prescription or its certified copy. After 15 days
                after receipt of the letter, the request will be considered
                accepted in the absence of a response. What role does mutual
                health insurance play? The charge taken into account by Social
                Security varies depending on the equipment in question. The
                brands and options thereof will also be considered as well as
                the patient's degree of disability . Generally speaking, the
                amount is set proportionally to the price of the material
                containing the bare essentials . If the patient decides to
                invest in more expensive equipment, he will bear the excess at
                his own expense. This is where mutual health insurance comes
                into play to reduce the remaining cost. Please note that these
                organizations apply separate treatment for optical equipment and
                hearing aids . In fact, their reimbursement differs from the
                rest of the medical equipment (orthosis, medical beds,
                dressings, canes, etc.). Contact your health insurance provider
                to find out the applicable reimbursement level . What medical
                equipment is covered? Any medical equipment present in the LPP
                list is eligible for reimbursement by social security under
                medical prescription . This may include a wheelchair for
                patients experiencing fatigue or difficulty moving around. For
                patients subject to serious pathologies involving long-term bed
                rest, a medical bed may be prescribed . Added to this are
                additional accessories such as anti-decubitus mattresses ,
                safety rails or a bed belt . In the most general cases, the
                prescription includes hearing or eye aids , crutches or even
                orthopedic shoes . In all cases, social security only covers
                part of the price of the equipment and the cost invoiced to the
                insured remains significant in the absence of mutual health
                insurance . Let's take the example of reimbursement for a
                walking stick with and without health insurance. With an average
                price of €32 for a varnished wooden cane, the remainder payable
                without mutual insurance amounts to €25.90 compared to €19.80
                with 200% mutual insurance . It is even possible to be exempt
                from the slightest charge thanks to the 600% mutual insurance .

                devices Cybersecurity of medical devices: How to guarantee the
                security of patient data? 11/13/2023 In France, cybersecurity is
                now a priority in the health and medico-social sector. The
                advent of digital technology and connected medical devices has
                led to a constant growth in cyber risks within health structures
                and in particular in health establishments such as hospitals,
                nursing homes, etc. According to data from the public activity
                report of CERT Santé (digital health agency), the number of
                structures having reported at least one incident increased by
                33% between 2021 and 2022. In fact, no less than 432 structures
                declared 592 incidents on the reporting portal in 2022 (1) .
                Recent cyber attacks against hospitals illustrate the scale of
                cyber malicious acts. They underline the interest in
                strengthening the protection of these structures. From this
                perspective, it is crucial to integrate the dimension of cyber
                risk during the acquisition and deployment of medical devices
                (MD). To do this, it is recommended to ensure that DMs respect
                these five essential steps for the security of the IT
                system:cybersecurity medical devices 1. Equip yourself with
                devices that are resistant to digital threats The first point to
                check when acquiring a medical device is its ability to resist
                digital threats. Cybersecure medical devices undergo rigorous
                professional penetration testing. They put devices through their
                paces to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities. A clear
                objective: to ensure that its devices are safe from malicious
                cyberattacks. Typically, these devices come with a hardened
                custom Linux kernel. The latter protects patient data against
                unauthorized access. It also ensures compliance with policies
                for managing sensitive data in hospitals and regulatory
                requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation
                (GDPR). 2. Customize device access control cybersecurity medical
                devices personalized accessCybersecurity also involves
                implementing appropriate access control. Indeed, extensive
                customization of device access control allows medical
                establishments or businesses to define the level of security
                that best suits their needs. For example, users may be required
                to authenticate using their personal username and password. This
                ensures that only authorized people have access to patient data.
                It is possible to go even further by giving administrators the
                ability to define user-specific roles. This allows them to
                carefully control access to data and configuration settings.
                User account management can be done remotely from an external
                server via the secure LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access
                Protocol) protocol or directly on any communicating medical
                device. Furthermore, for security reasons, it is preferable to
                automate the disconnection of users after a predefined period of
                inactivity. 3. Ensure data integrity Cybersecurity of medical
                devices data integrityIn healthcare, data integrity is
                essential. Interfacing the devices with the information system
                is ideal for guaranteeing patient identification and proper data
                retention while reducing the risk of errors, intentional or not.
                SAYAH, [2/24/2024 4:26 PM] Indeed, thanks to bidirectional
                communication between the hospital patient database (Hospital
                Information System: SIH) and the device, the latter can directly
                import the data by means of a patient data query (PDQ) by
                entering only the patient identifier. Furthermore, when
                available, the deployment of a barcode reader can facilitate
                patient identification. Finally, certain devices allow you to
                work in a worklist in order to predefine the list of patients to
                be examined from the HIS. These tools reduce data entry errors
                and ensure data correlation at each stage of care. But their
                deployment requires devices compatible with the establishment's
                communication protocols (HL7 or DICOM). 4. Secure data in
                transit Cybersecurity of medical devices security of data in
                transitSecurity of data in transit is a major concern. Data
                transmitted between devices and systems must remain
                confidential. To achieve this goal, encryption must be performed
                using the SSL/TLS protocol. The latter offers strong protection
                during transmission. Wireless network security is essential. So,
                using secure Wi-Fi protocols like WPA2 Enterprise with
                certificate authentication is ideal for protecting transferred
                data. It is also recommended to have mechanisms in place to
                automatically delete data stored on devices after it has been
                transferred to the HIS system to reduce the risk of leakage. 5.
                Set up and analyze audit logs In order to strengthen security
                and transparency, comprehensive audit and security logs must be
                put in place on: Waiters ; Applications ; Softwares ; And
                medical devices. Cybersecurity of medical devices maintain audit
                logsThese logs record activity in a computer system or network
                in detail. They allow you to chronologically track various
                events, even previous ones, such as connection attempts, file
                access, system configuration modifications, etc. It is therefore
                essential to regularly monitor and analyze audit logs to detect
                and prevent security incidents. If in doubt, renewal of all
                accounts should be considered.

            <div><h1>10 Ways to Keep Your Heart Healthy</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Living with a heart condition can feel daunting but even small
                changes can make a significant difference in your well-being. At
                AMS Cardiology, we believe in empowering our patients to take
                charge of their heart health. That’s why we’ve compiled ten
                practical tips on how to improve heart health so you don’t have
                to navigate this journey alone. Embrace Movement Every Day: Aim
                for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week
                or 75 minutes of vigorous activity. Even small bursts of
                movement like brisk walking or gardening can benefit your heart.
                Remember, consistency is key! Fuel Your Body Wisely: Choose a
                balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean
                protein. Limit saturated and trans fats, processed foods and
                added sugars. Befriend Fiber: Fiber helps lower cholesterol and
                manage blood sugar, both crucial for heart health. Include
                beans, lentils, whole grains and fruits in your diet to increase
                your fiber intake. Don’t Skip the Sleep: Aim for 7-8 hours of
                quality sleep each night. Poor sleep can contribute to high
                blood pressure and other heart risks. Establish a relaxing
                bedtime routine and create a sleep-conducive environment. Manage
                Stress: Chronic stress can take a toll on your heart. Practice
                stress-management techniques like yoga, meditation, deep
                breathing or spending time in nature to find what works best for
                you. Partner With Your Doctor: One of our favorite healthy heart
                tips is scheduling regular visits with your doctor. Routine
                checkups are crucial for monitoring your heart health and
                adjusting your treatment plan as needed. Discuss any concerns or
                changes you experience with your cardiologist at AMS Cardiology.
                Stay Hydrated: Water is essential for overall health including
                your heart. Aim for eight glasses of water daily and adjust
                based on your activity level and climate. Quit Smoking: Smoking
                is a significant risk factor for heart disease. If you smoke,
                quitting is the single most impactful step you can take on your
                journey of learning how to improve your heart health. Talk to
                your doctor about smoking cessation resources and support
                groups. Know Your Numbers: Monitor your blood pressure,
                cholesterol and blood sugar levels regularly. Understanding
                these numbers empowers you to manage your health and make
                informed decisions. Celebrate Small Victories: Acknowledge and
                celebrate your progress no matter how small. Every action, from
                incorporating a healthy recipe into your diet to taking a walk,
                contributes to your overall well-being. Remember, you’re not
                alone on this journey. At AMS Cardiology, we’re dedicated to

                causes of the disease. At AMS Cardiology our dedicated team
                employs a multi-faceted approach to peripheral artery disease
                treatment combining effective and personalized care based on
                individual needs. Several ways we help patients with PAD
                include: Lifestyle Modifications – Lifestyle changes form the
                cornerstone of PAD treatment. Patients are encouraged to adopt a
                heart-healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, a
                balanced peripheral artery disease diet low in saturated fats
                and smoking cessation. These modifications contribute to
                improved blood flow, weight management and overall
                cardiovascular health. Medications – Medications play a crucial
                role in managing PAD symptoms. Antiplatelet medicines help to
                reduce the risk of blood clots while statins help to lower blood
                cholesterol levels and stabilize plaque in the arteries. Blood
                Sugar Management and Blood Pressure Control – For individuals
                with diabetes, managing blood sugar levels and blood pressure is
                essential in preventing complications and managing PAD.
                Minimally Invasive Procedures – In cases where the above alone
                are insufficient, minimally invasive procedures can help.
                Angioplasty and stenting are common interventions to widen
                narrowed arteries and improve blood flow. Surgical Options – In
                the most advanced cases or when other interventions are
                ineffective, surgical options may be necessary. Why AMS
                Cardiology? At AMS Cardiology, our mission is to empower
                patients to take control of their heart health and live
                healthily. By adopting a holistic approach that encompasses
                regular exercise, a heart-healthy diet, smoking cessation and
                regular checkups, you can pave the way toward preventing
                peripheral artery disease.

            <div><h1>The Role of Genetics in Heart Disease Risk</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                heart disease In the cardiology world, understanding the
                intricate connection between genetics and heart disease is of
                paramount importance. At AMS Cardiology, we recognize that
                prevention is at the core of our practice. Below, we explore the
                relationship between genetics and heart disease, shedding light
                on the key factors contributing to a person being at risk. We
                examine the question “Is heart disease genetic?” and discuss the
                critical role of genetics in heart disease prevention. Is Heart
                Disease Genetic? Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of
                death worldwide. It encompasses a range of conditions, including
                coronary artery disease, heart failure and arrhythmias. While
                lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise and smoking play a
                significant role in the development of heart disease, genetics
                also contribute substantially. Genetic Predisposition Genetic
                predisposition to heart disease is a reality for many
                individuals. A family history of cardiovascular disease is a
                well-established risk factor. If your parents or siblings have
                suffered from cardiovascular disease you are more likely to be
                at an increased risk due to shared genetics. Specific gene
                variations can raise the likelihood of developing heart
                conditions. Mendelian Disorders and Polygenic Risk Some heart
                diseases have a clear genetic base, known as Mendelian
                disorders. These conditions are caused by a single gene mutation
                and manifest early in life. In addition to Mendelian disorders,
                heart disease risk is influenced by several genetic variants
                making it a polygenic trait. Researchers identified hundreds of
                genetic markers associated with heart disease risk. Heart
                Disease Prevention and Genetics Preventative cardiology is the
                best way to reduce your risk of heart disease. Understanding the
                genetic component of cardiovascular disease can help you
                understand your risk and help you create effective prevention
                plans. Below, we discuss several methods to reduce your risk of
                heart disease: Personalized Risk Assessment – Genetic testing
                can provide valuable insight into an individual’s risk profile.
                By identifying specific gene markers cardiologists can assess a
                patient’s susceptibility to various heart conditions and offer
                personalized prevention plans. Lifestyle Modification – While
                genetics plays a significant role, lifestyle factors such as
                diet and exercise also remain pivotal in heart disease
                prevention. Adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle is the best way
                to reduce your risk. Your cardiologist might recommend a change
                in your diet or an increase in physical activity.

                flavor or use their juice to add brightness to your marinades
                and dressings. Fantastic Tomatoes Tomatoes, a staple of summer
                foods, are not only delicious but also excellent for heart
                health. They are a great source of lycopene, an antioxidant
                known for its protective effects on the heart. Enjoy fresh
                tomatoes in salads, as a base for flavorful salsas or roasted
                with a drizzle of olive oil for a simple yet healthy side dish.
                Wonderful Watermelon Summer wouldn’t be complete without
                watermelon! This hydrating fruit is not only a delicious way to
                quench your thirst but also a good source of lycopene and
                vitamins A and C. Watermelon’s natural sweetness makes it a
                delightful and healthy summer food. You can even try a grilled
                watermelon steak for a fun twist! Refreshing Cucumbers Cucumbers
                are a cool and refreshing addition to summer foods. They are low
                in calories and high in hydration, making them an excellent
                choice to support heart health. Enjoy cucumber slices in salads,
                add them to chilled soups or infuse water with their mild flavor
                for a refreshing and heart-healthy beverage. Nutritious Avocados
                Avocados are packed with good fats that contribute to heart
                health. They are rich in monounsaturated fats, which can help

                packed with good fats and fiber, making them one of the best
                summer foods to add to your diet. Sprinkle them over yogurt,
                salads or smoothies or enjoy them as a satisfying and nutritious
                snack. Including heart-healthy foods in your meals provides
                important nutrients to support your cardiovascular health. By
                making these wholesome choices a regular part of your summer
                dinners, you can nourish your heart and savor the best of summer
                while maintaining a heart-healthy diet.

            <div>
              <p>
                Maintaining a heart-healthy diet is an essential aspect of
                preventative cardiology, helping to reduce the risk of heart
                disease and promote overall cardiovascular well-being. By
                incorporating nutrient-rich foods into your daily meals, you can
                support a healthy heart and embrace heart-healthy habits. Let’s
                explore some practical tips for a heart-healthy diet,
                highlighting a few foods that promote cardiovascular health and
                providing guidance on making wholesome choices. Fill Your Plate
                with Fruits and Vegetables Fruits and vegetables are powerhouse
                foods for a healthy heart. Packed with vitamins, minerals and
                antioxidants, they help protect against heart disease. Aim for a
                colorful variety of fruits and vegetables, such as berries,
                leafy greens, citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables. They
                offer a variety of benefits from their heart-protective
                properties. Embrace Whole Grains Swap refined grains for whole
                grains to boost your heart health. Whole grains, like oats,
                quinoa, brown rice and whole wheat, are rich in fiber, vitamins
                and minerals. They can help lower cholesterol levels and
                stabilize blood sugar levels, reducing the risk of heart disease
                and promoting optimal cardiovascular function. Include Low-Fat
                and Fat-Free Dairy Low-fat and fat-free dairy products provide
                essential nutrients without the added saturated fats. Opt for
                skim milk, low-fat yogurt and reduced-fat cheese to incorporate
                calcium, vitamin D and protein into your diet while minimizing
                the intake of unhealthy fats. Opt for Protein-Rich Foods Choose
                lean sources of protein, such as fish, skinless poultry,
                legumes, eggs, nuts and seeds. These foods provide necessary
                protein, omega-3 fatty acids and fiber without the excess
                saturated fats found in some animal products. Omega-3 fatty
                acids are particularly beneficial for heart health, as they help
                reduce inflammation and support healthy blood vessels. Practice
                Portion Control Maintaining heart-healthy habits also involves
                portion control. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight
                gain and other cardiovascular risks when consumed in excess. Eat
                slowly and try to avoid using screens at mealtimes. Pay
                attention to serving sizes and listen to your body’s hunger and
                fullness cues. Incorporate Healthy Fats Not all fats are created
                equal, and it’s important to include heart-healthy fats in your
                diet. Opt for unsaturated fats found in olive oil, avocados,
                nuts and seeds. These fats help lower cholesterol levels and
                reduce the risk of heart disease when consumed in moderation.
                Mind the Salt Excessive sodium consumption can lead to high
                blood pressure, a significant risk factor for heart disease.
                Limit your intake of processed and packaged foods, as they often
                contain a great deal of salt. Instead, flavor your meals with
                herbs, spices, and natural seasonings to reduce reliance on
                added salt. Developing life-long heart-healthy habits is an
                essential aspect of preventative cardiology, helping to reduce
                the risk of heart disease and promote overall cardiovascular
                well-being. By incorporating nutrient-rich foods into your daily
                meals, you can support a healthy heart and embrace heart-healthy
                habits. To learn more about preventative cardiology and what you

              <h1>What does a Cardiologist do?: How to Work with One</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Question: Is the cardiologist covered by my insurance? Why it
                matters: Nobody wants surprise medical expenses. Double-check
                with your insurance company or with the cardiology office to
                make sure they are in your network. Question: What do the
                cardiologist’s current patients have to say? Why it matters:
                Talk to friends and family in your community. While online
                reviews can be helpful, you’re more likely to get an honest,
                unbiased answer from a current patient than a review on the
                Internet. After You Find a Cardiologist Once you’ve chosen a
                cardiologist, you’ll need to prepare for your first visit.
                Here’s how: Write down your personal health history and the
                health history of your family Write down a list of medications
                you’re taking Gather any recent results from heart tests Make a
                list of questions to ask your cardiologist When you see your
                cardiologist, they may perform some tests or refer you to
                another specialist for a test or treatment. You might also work
                with other medical professionals to manage your condition,
                including: Dietitians Pharmacists Endocrinologists (hormone
                doctors) Podiatrists (foot doctors)
                Ophthalmologists/optometrists (eye doctors) Remember, your
                primary care physician is still your doctor, too! They may
                coordinate your care if you need to see multiple doctors, and
                they’ll also help you manage your heart disease long-term.

              <h1>What is Arteriosclerosis and How Do I Prevent It?</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                artery disease Arteriosclerosis isn't limited to heart vessels.
                It also appears as peripheral artery disease (PAD), which is a
                narrowing in the arteries beyond the heart, Dr. Kolansky
                explains. PAD can arise in the legs and in the carotid arteries,
                which supply blood to the head and aorta. "Patients should be
                aware of symptoms such as pain in the lower extremities (legs)
                when walking, as this could be a sign of lower extremity
                peripheral artery disease," Dr. Kolansky says. "And carotid
                artery disease may present itself as a temporary stroke,
                referred to as a transient ischemic attack, or TIA," he adds.
                "This is a warning sign that patients should be aware of, and if
                it occurs, they should seek medical attention immediately."
                Symptoms of a transient ischemic attack include: Numbness or
                tingling in the face Temporary loss of vision, especially in one
                eye Dizziness or loss of balance A sudden, severe headache As
                with coronary artery disease, the first line of treatment for
                both peripheral and carotid artery disease is prevention, Dr.
                Kolansky says. And these forms of arteriosclerosis can also be
                treated with revascularization techniques, including stenting or
                surgery. Aortic aneurysm Many people think of aneurysms as
                problems that occur in the brain. But aortic aneurysms are a
                third form of arteriosclerosis to be aware of. This is an
                abnormal enlargement in the aorta, your body's largest blood
                vessel. This enlargement can weaken the wall of the aorta, and
                there is a risk of aortic aneurysm rupture, which can be fatal.
                SAYAH, [2/24/2024 10:44 AM] Dr. Kolansky warns that aortic
                aneurysms can be "silent" — meaning there are no outward
                symptoms — and go undetected until a routine screening. But
                there can also be noticeable symptoms, including discomfort in
                the abdomen or back. In certain patients, such as those who
                smoke and have hypertension (high blood pressure), screening
                might be appropriate. "Aortic aneurysms are treated by reducing
                blood pressure and, often, with vascular stenting or surgery,"
                says Dr. Kolansky. "The goal of surgery is to prevent the
                aneurysm from expanding or rupturing." Aortic aneurysms are
                typically diagnosed with imaging, such as: An ultrasound A
                computed tomography (CT) scan A computed tomography angiogram
                (CTA) — this procedure involves injecting a contrast dye into
                your veins and creating images of your blood vessels Penn is
                currently the largest referral center for complex aortic surgery
                in the region. Additionally, Penn's vascular and cardiothoracic
                surgeons are world leaders in this field, and have a range of
                treatment options available. Although arteriosclerosis is a
                condition that can lead to serious issues, it can be prevented
                with healthy lifestyle habits. Work with your doctor on creating
                an action plan for now and the future.

                glasses or unused contacts and solutions and in some states even
                unused prescription drugs? This is a fantastic way to give back
                and help others access essential eye care services. These can
                typically be written off as a taxable donation as well.
                Remember, your eyes are precious. This tax season, prioritize
                your vision health and invest in a brighter future, one clear

                have more benefits, and it’s important to know whether you have
                one version or the other. At Medical Eye Center, a standard
                refraction or eye exam may cost $60 if no other insurance
                benefits can be applied. VSP benefits will also provide a 15%
                discount on LASIK surgery, which is deemed an elective procedure
                and not typically covered by insurance benefits. This allows the
                cost for LASIK surgery to drop from $5500 to just $4675 for VSP
                covered patients. If not going the LASIK route and sticking with
                contacts, VSP coverage allows for patients with astigmatism who
                need a corneal scleral lens and significant benefit of coverage
                on $1000 for a contact lens fitting and exam and often hundreds
                towards the lenses themselves. Here is a helpful link to verify
                your coverage with VSP – https://bit.ly/3vOsCEQ Here is a
                helpful link to verify your coverage with Medicare Advantage –
                https://bit.ly/3vC6HRw Non-Contracted Plans: While we have
                affiliations with various vision plans, we must note the plans
                we are not contracted with, including Spectera Vision, Davis
                Vision, Jackson Care Connect, EyeMed, and Medicare DMERC for
                post-op glasses. However, patients with these plans may still
                enjoy a 20% discount on most optical purchases if they decide to
                buy from Medical Eye Center. If you have non-contracted
                insurance providers, you may be able to submit paperwork
                independently as a patient and get reimbursed for your optical
                purchases. It’s worth checking with your insurance company to
                see if this is an option for you Exceptions to coverage: Medical
                Eye Center accepts most major medical plans, and we understand
                the nuances of deductibles, copays, and coinsurance. At the same
                time, many medical plans cover some or all of the refraction
                charge, exceptions exist, such as Regence BCBS Commercial plan,
                Wellcare MedAdvantage, and certain Medicare plans as mentioned
                earlier. Additionally, a few other plans that often do not cover
                refractions are HealthNet of OR, Blue Cross Government, Anthem,
                MODA Advantage, and PacificSource Medicare. When used as
                secondary insurance or Tricare For Life and some other plans,
                the Oregon Health Plan covers refraction costs or a portion of
                it. Addressing Plan Denials: When a patient’s plan denies
                coverage for the refraction charge, we offer a $9 discount,
                ensuring that our patients receive fair and transparent pricing.
                Our commitment to transparency extends to our interaction with
                Veteran PGBA contracted providers. At Medical Eye Center, we
                believe transparent pricing is fundamental to building trust and
                ensuring our patients understand their financial
                responsibilities. By providing detailed information about our
                pricing structure, we empower our patients to make informed
                decisions about their eye care, fostering a positive and open
                healthcare experience. “If you ever have any confusion regarding
                what expenses are covered and what are not during your visit,

                watching the eclipse through reputable livestreams online or by
                visiting an observatory or planetarium hosting safe viewing
                events. These venues typically provide the necessary equipment
                for safe eclipse-watching. Supervise children to ensure their
                eye safety: Supervising children during a solar eclipse is
                crucial to ensure their safety, as they may not fully grasp the
                potential dangers of looking directly at the sun. Before the
                eclipse, remember to explain the risks using age-appropriate
                language and provide children with certified eclipse glasses or
                solar viewers, ensuring they wear them correctly. Additionally,
                actively engage with children, answer their questions, and lead
                by example by using proper eye protection. The next solar
                eclipse is happening on October 14th, and you can prepare by

                Conditions like glaucoma and macular degeneration have a
                hereditary component. Numerous eye issues have genetic links,
                and your susceptibility to conditions like macular degeneration
                significantly increases if a close family member has experienced
                it. Likewise, your risk of glaucoma can be four to nine times
                higher than average if it’s prevalent in your family. Engage in
                conversations with your relatives about their eye conditions;
                this dialogue can serve as a valuable tool in collaboration with
                your Ophthalmologist. By staying informed and identifying
                potential issues ahead of time, you and your eye care specialist
                can work together to detect and treat conditions early. Taking
                proactive steps now will help you easily navigate the digital
                landscape and contribute to your overall well-being. Protecting
                your vision is an investment in your future eyesight, whether in
                an office, a classroom, or the great outdoors. Our staff here at
                Medical Eye Center would love to partner with you toward these

                opportunity for families to come together, enjoy food, drinks,
                games, and most importantly, prioritize their children’s eye
                health. This event is important to our staff and allows us to
                work hand-in-hand with community members to prioritize
                children’s eye care. Children’s Eye Health and Safety Month is
                an annual reminder of the importance of protecting our young
                ones’ vision. By giving priority to regular eye exams,
                familiarizing yourself with common eye conditions, and ensuring
                proper care for eyewear, together we can protect their vision
                and pave the way for a brighter and healthier future. (Please

                effectively reduce glare and provide excellent UV protection.
                Additionally, opt for sunglasses that offer full coverage to
                shield your eyes from the sun’s rays coming from different
                angles (if you need assistance choosing the right outdoor
                sunwear, our staff can assist you). Don’t forget to wear a
                wide-brimmed hat or a visor to further block direct sunlight and
                provide additional shade for your eyes. It’s also beneficial to
                apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen around your eyes to protect the
                delicate skin from sunburn. Lastly, stay hydrated and use

            <div><h1>Basic Tips for Keeping Your Eyes Healthy</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                A crucial yet oft-overlooked component of a high-quality life is
                healthy eyesight. Approximately one in six adults grapple with
                sight-threatening eye conditions, while a significant number
                experience some degree of vision loss as they age. Aging is a
                risk factor for prevalent causes of blindness, such as glaucoma,
                diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and cataracts.
                However, there are proactive steps we can take to minimize the
                likelihood of developing these conditions and safeguard our eye
                health. Lifelong Healthy Habits Eating a nutritious diet and
                staying physically active contribute to more than just weight
                management; they are also integral to eye health. Fruits and
                dark leafy greens play a crucial role in maintaining optimal eye
                health. Regular exercise and avoiding detrimental habits like
                smoking, a substantial risk factor for various sight-threatening
                conditions, further support overall eye well-being. Don’t Skip
                Doctor Visits Untreated chronic conditions such as high blood
                pressure and diabetes can lead to severe eye problems and other
                health complications. Diabetes elevates the risk of macular
                degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, while untreated high
                blood pressure increases the likelihood of eye strokes. Regular
                doctor visits can make a significant difference in eye health by
                facilitating early diagnosis and intervention. Keep Track of
                Changes in Vision Most alterations in eyesight are gradual,
                making them challenging to detect initially. Any changes you
                notice should prompt a visit to the eye doctor. Timely
                appointments can lead to updated prescriptions or the
                identification of early signs of developing eye conditions.
                Sudden changes in vision, such as flashes of light, dark
                curtains over vision, blurry vision, or a sudden increase in
                floaters, warrant urgent attention, as they may indicate retinal
                detachment, a condition that demands immediate treatment to
                prevent permanent vision loss. Know Your Eye Disease Risk
                Factors In addition to age, family history of eye diseases,
                diabetes, or high blood pressure heightens the risk of
                developing these conditions. While age and genetics are beyond
                our control, we can influence our diet, exercise, use protective
                eyewear like sunglasses, and adhere to a regular eye exam
                schedule. The Importance of UV-Blocking Sunglasses UV rays from
                sunlight accumulate and cause permanent damage to our eyes over
                time. Protecting our eyes from sunlight is as vital as
                safeguarding our skin. Choose sunglasses that block 100% of UV-A
                and UV-B rays, as indicated on the label. Polarized lenses,
                though pricier, effectively block glare from multiple
                directions, making them ideal for bright days, especially when
                driving. Eye Exams Should Be a Priority Regular eye exams are
                paramount. While modern medicine may not reverse many
                sight-threatening conditions, early detection can slow or halt
                their progression. A routine eye exam can be the decisive factor
                between permanent vision loss and enjoying decades of healthy
                eyesight. Consult with us about your optimal eye exam frequency
                during your next appointment, where we can also share additional
                tips for maintaining healthy vision. We value your presence in
                our practice family!

                if it's someone just being nosy or wondering if you've got a
                hidden stash, feel free to brush this comment off: "We're
                handling the costs just fine." Next subject. "Why don't you just
                adopt? There are a lot of kids out there." The underlying social
                commentary here can be really hard to take. While the person may
                be trying to offer a solution, this comment implies that
                something's wrong with wanting to experience pregnancy and give
                birth to your own child, or that adopting an infant will be
                easier. It also implies that you should give up trying to
                conceive. This might be the hardest comment to respond to
                because just about anything you say could continue the
                conversation. If you choose to address this question, here's the
                truth: You and your partner owe it to yourselves to try until
                you feel at peace about moving on to the next possibility. That
                may mean adoption. It may mean trying another fertility
                treatment. The best way to address this comment but end the
                conversation is to be direct: "We know that adoption is an
                alternative, but we're not ready to give up trying to conceive."

                Ovarian Cysts and Pregnancy: Could A Cyst Stop Me from Having a
                Baby?

                Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form on the ovaries.
                Simple ovarian cysts usually are not cancerous. Most cysts are
                diagnosed through ultrasound or other imaging tests, which will
                also let your physician see the size of the cysts. While most
                cysts do not cause symptoms, if a cyst ruptures you may feel
                sudden pain and discomfort. If you have been diagnosed with
                ovarian cysts and are trying to get pregnant, it’s important to
                know that ovarian cysts don’t typically cause problems with
                fertility. However, there are always exceptions to the rule.
                Endometriosis May Cause Cysts and Fertility Issues Cysts do not
                generally make it harder to get pregnant. But if the cysts are
                caused by an underlying condition like endometriosis, you might
                have problems with fertility. Endometriosis is a common
                condition that affects more than 1 in 10 women of reproductive
                age in the United States. Endometriosis is a condition in which
                tissues that are similar to the lining of your uterus implant or
                grow on the outside of the uterus, such as on your ovaries or
                fallopian tubes. While it’s still possible to get pregnant,
                endometriosis does decrease fertility. 30-40% of women with
                endometriosis may struggle with infertility. Talk to your doctor
                about treatment options that are available for endometriosis and
                to help meet your individual fertility goals. Polycystic Ovary
                Syndrome and Ovarian Cysts If you have clusters of pearl-sized
                cysts or follicles, you might have a condition called polycystic
                ovary syndrome — a leading cause of infertility in women. Your
                ovaries contain eggs, which are present in the ovaries from a
                woman’s development as a fetus. These eggs get released each
                month during the ovulation phase of your menstrual cycle. The
                eggs are in tiny sacs called follicles that fill up with fluid
                as the eggs mature. Normally, the follicles break open to
                release the matured eggs, sending them to the womb for
                fertilization. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome do not
                make all of the hormones needed for the eggs to fully mature.
                The follicles grow and build up fluid, but the eggs do not get
                released. Ovulation does not occur, and the follicles remain
                dormant.. If this happens, your body might fail to make the
                hormone progesterone, which is needed to keep your cycle
                regular. Ovarian Cysts and Pregnancy Ovarian cysts are common
                during early pregnancy, even though you’re no longer
                menstruating. Usually, these cysts are harmless just like most
                other ovarian cysts. However, there are a few possible problems
                if the cysts continue to grow throughout your pregnancy. They
                might rupture, twist, or even cause problems during childbirth.
                This is one of the many reasons it’s important to stay under the
                care of an obstetrician/gynecologist during your pregnancy, and
                throughout your life. If you have polycystic ovary syndrome, you
                might have an increased risk of gestational diabetes,
                pregnancy-induced high blood pressure, miscarriage, or premature
                delivery. Talk with your OB/GYN about your risk and potential
                treatment options. She’ll provide you with a thorough set of
                options and recommend the best course of treatment to help you
                have the healthiest pregnancy possible.

                Today is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, a part of
                the larger month-long “celebration” of the lives we’ll never
                know, but will always be in our hearts. Usually I think of
                awareness months as tacky, but that’s because I’ve never really
                belonged to a population that recognizes one. I feel like I’ve
                recently joined this club, but when I sit back and think about
                it, I’ve been a member for years. Unexplained infertility: A
                frustrating diagnosis Four years ago my husband and I embarked
                on the “fun” journey of trying to conceive a child. When 9
                months of trying hit, we went to the specialists at Penn
                Fertility Care to be evaluated. After a few months of testing,
                we came out with the frustrating diagnosis of unexplained
                infertility. But we had a plan: try three IUIs. Unfortunately,
                each IUI was unsuccessful and came with cysts that took a few
                months to resolve before we could try the next round. It was a
                year before we finished our plan and it was time to move on.
                From IUI to IVF Moving to IVF was a big and scary step. I cried
                on the corner of 3701 Market St. after getting the overview. I
                cried for my loss of any sort of normalcy. But Penn’s nurses and
                education classes made the jump to the next level much less
                daunting. The injections weren’t as painful as I imagined, and I
                felt empowered and strong to be doing this. I felt lucky to have
                a team to believe that IVF would work for me, even though the
                first round of medication didn’t have a strong effect on my body
                and I would have to repeat the cycle. The second round of
                medications worked perfectly. The egg retrieval was my first
                time ever under anesthesia, and everything went fine. Ten days
                later I went in for my embryo transfer and came out with a
                perfect looking picture of my 4AA embryo that was now in my
                body. I felt like IVF was a miracle and I was so lucky to have
                seasoned doctors to help guide me through the process. Nine
                months later, I held my healthy son in my arms and jumped right
                into motherhood and didn’t look back. Pregnancy, doubt and loss
                3AA embryoFast forward 18 months. I’m back and ready to have it
                go perfectly again, despite a global pandemic. I just assumed
                that it would work, especially since it took two and a half
                years to get pregnant the first time around. I deserved an easy
                time. My doctor carefully explained the process and my options
                of transferring one of my embryos: I have the option to do a
                natural cycle! That means basically no shots! I am carefully
                monitored with blood work and ultrasounds and do a frozen embryo
                transfer. I’m pregnant! But the initial hCG levels are way lower
                than my son, but that’s okay because the range varies so much.
                However, the feeling of doubt is in my mind. The six-week
                ultrasound did not have remotely the same image as my son, and
                at eight-weeks I was told officially that there was no heartbeat
                and the pregnancy was not viable. I had a D&E that week, and
                found out later that my baby had chromosomal abnormalities, a
                common reason for miscarriage. I’m still waiting for my hCG to
                fall back to zero, five weeks after the procedure. I am
                exhausted. SAYAH, [2/24/2024 11:03 AM] Honoring loss and finding
                hope Dad holds son up in the air by the shoreSo here I am, a
                member of a club no one wants to be a part of. I’m thinking
                about what this month means to me now and how this experience
                has changed me and will shape the rest of my life. I feel lucky
                to be offered some solace that this was not my fault, when I
                know many mothers struggle with whys and what ifs. I feel lucky
                to have a son from a cycle that was perfect. I feel humbled and
                a little embarrassed by how entitled I felt to be able to have
                another child. I feel connected to many people I’ve never met
                that have gone through this and will go through it in the
                future. But most importantly, I still feel hopeful and
                determined despite being in the thick of it. I believe in modern
                medicine and science and my team at Penn Medicine: The nurses
                that call me every other day with the results of my blood work.

            <div><h1>A Step-By-Step Look at the IVF Process</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                When you think of common fertility treatments, in vitro
                fertilization (IVF) probably appears near the top of your list.
                There's a reason for that. IVF has been around for decades and
                you most likely already know the basic idea behind IVF: uniting
                egg and sperm outside the body in a culture. But there's so much
                more to IVF that happens before and after that. Here's a closer
                look at the IVF process in five steps. IVF is commonly used to
                treat: Older women with fertility issues Women with damaged or
                blocked fallopian tubes Women with endometriosis Male
                infertility caused by low sperm count or blockage The IVF
                Process in Five Steps Boost your egg production through
                superovulation You'll be given fertility drugs that will begin a
                process called stimulation — or superovulation, says the
                National Institutes of Health (NIH). In other words, the drugs —
                which contain Follicle Stimulating Hormone — will tell your body
                to produce more than just the normal one egg per month. The more
                eggs you produce, the more chances you'll have of a successful
                fertilization later on in the treatment. You'll receive
                transvaginal ultrasounds and blood tests on a regular basis
                during this step in the IVF process to check on your ovaries and
                monitor your hormone levels. Remove the eggs A little more than
                a day before your eggs are scheduled to be retrieved from your
                body, you'll receive a hormone injection that will help your
                eggs mature quickly. Then, you'll have a minor surgical
                procedure — called follicular aspiration — to remove the eggs.
                This is generally done as an outpatient surgery in your doctor's
                office, according to the NIH. During the procedure, your doctor
                will use an ultrasound to guide a thin needle into each of your
                ovaries through your vagina. The needle has a device attached to
                it that suctions the eggs out one at a time. If this part sounds
                painful, don't worry — you'll probably be given medication
                beforehand so that you won't feel any discomfort. You may
                experience some cramping afterward, but this usually disappears
                within a day, the NIH explains. Collect sperm from your partner
                or a donor While your eggs are being removed, your partner will
                provide a sperm sample. You also may choose to use donor sperm.
                The sperm are then put through a high-speed wash and spin cycle
                in order to find the healthiest ones. Unite sperm and eggs Now
                comes the part of IVF that everyone's the most familiar with —
                combining the best sperm with your best eggs. This stage is
                called insemination. It usually takes a few hours for a sperm to
                fertilize an egg. Your doctor may also inject the sperm directly
                into the egg instead, a process known as intracytoplasmic sperm
                injection (ICSI). Transfer the embryo(s) into your uterus Once
                your eggs have been collected you'll receive yet another
                medication. This one is meant to prep the lining of your uterus
                to receive the embryos that will be transferred back into you.
                About three to five days after fertilization, your doctor will
                place the embryos in your uterus using a catheter. Like step
                number three, this part of IVF is performed in your doctor's
                office while you are awake. Multiple embryos are transferred
                back into you in the hopes that at least one will implant itself
                in the lining of your uterus and begin to develop. Sometimes
                more than one embryo ends up implanting, which is why multiples
                are common in women who use IVF. The IVF process basically
                replicates natural reproduction. The next step after the IVF
                process determines whether the procedure worked — the pregnancy
                test.

              <p>
                potentially unaware of their condition. The PCOS Foundation
                estimates that this condition is the cause of fertility issues
                in women who have trouble with ovulation around 70 percent of
                the time. Myth #4: You Can't Get Pregnant if You Have PCOS This
                isn’t true for everyone. Give your body a chance by talking with
                your doctor about fertility treatment. A number of medications
                can stimulate ovulation, which is the main issue that women with
                PCOS face. Other fertility treatments for women with PCOS
                include assisted reproductive technologies such as in vitro
                fertilization. “If you have PCOS and are not trying to get
                pregnant, don’t assume that you’re in the clear. While it is
                certainly harder to get pregnant with PCOS, many women still
                ovulate intermittently. Therefore, it’s important to still use
                contraception,” cautioned Dr. Sloane. Myth #5: PCOS Only Affects
                Overweight Women It is true that many women who have PCOS are
                overweight or obese. And it's also true that obesity can make
                PCOS symptoms worse. However, PCOS does not discriminate and can
                affect women of all shapes and sizes. The relationship between
                weight and PCOS has to do with the body's inability to use
                insulin properly, which can lead to weight gain. That's why
                getting into the habit of eating healthy and exercising
                regularly is recommended as part of most women's treatment plan.
                By separating fact from myth, you can empower yourself to live a
                complete, healthy life with PCOS

                In recent news and media coverage, you may have heard about the
                increasing number of women who choose egg freezing as a way to
                delay childbearing without the risk of their most fertile years
                passing them by. That's because the popularity of this process
                is on the rise. "I'm seeing a lot more patients coming in for
                egg freezing," says Suleena Kansal Kalra, MD, MSCE at Penn
                Fertility Care. "Women come in and say, 'You know what? I'm
                traveling a lot; I'm building my career; I'm 37 years old. I
                haven't met Mr. Right, and I'm really not sure I'm going to in
                the next year or so, and I want to do something to take charge
                of my fertility.'" Here's what you should know about how egg
                freezing works and if it's the right option for you. What is the
                Egg-Freezing Process? During a normal menstrual cycle, "there's
                a signal from your brain each month to release one egg," Dr.
                Kalra explains. "But we want 10 or more for egg freezing." Egg
                freezing is done in three steps: Hormone injections stimulate
                your ovaries to produce many eggs. A physician monitors your
                eggs and hormone levels. The eggs are retrieved, using a
                transvaginal ultrasound to guide the process, and are
                immediately frozen. "Women take about 10 to 12 days of shots on
                average, and they come in for bloodwork and monitoring," says
                Dr. Kalra. "Then we do the egg retrieval, generally within about
                two weeks of starting the medication. The eggs are flash frozen
                in a process called vitrification." Does Egg Freezing Work? Over
                the past few years, oocyte cryopreservation has risen, from 475
                women freezing their eggs in 2009 to 6,207 women in 2015,
                according to the most recent data from the Society of Assisted
                Reproductive Technology (SART). SART is a professional
                organization that helps maintain the standards of assisted
                reproductive technologies — including in vitro fertilization —
                in the United States. As with any fertility treatment, "It's not
                a guarantee, but it's certainly an option," Dr. Kalra explains.
                As of 2015, the most recent year for which data is available,
                about 2,000 children had been born worldwide as a result of egg
                freezing. SART also stopped considering egg freezing an
                experimental procedure back in 2012, and conceiving using frozen
                eggs does not increase the risk of pregnancy complications or
                birth defects. Is Egg Freezing the Right Option? You may want to
                consider egg freezing if you know you want to have children, but
                you aren't at the point in your life where you're ready to
                become a parent. When should you freeze your eggs?Cancer
                patients may also want to consider egg freezing as a means of
                fertility preservation before having chemotherapy. "Ideally, the
                best time to do it is before 35. The idea is to do it before
                your egg supply is starting to decline more rapidly," Dr. Kalra
                says. "You can come back when you're 40 and think that you're at
                the point where you're ready to start your family." As for how
                long eggs can stay frozen, "There's no expiration date," Dr.
                Kalra says. "But the ideal time to come back for your eggs is
                when you're healthy and in good shape." Ultimately, the decision
                to freeze your eggs is one you must make carefully. If you're
                considering egg freezing, a Penn Fertility Care specialist can

                When you’re experiencing infertility, the stress, anxiety and
                loneliness that often accompany it can be difficult to manage.
                And once fertility treatments begin, those feelings can magnify.
                We talked with Dr. Suleena Kansal Kalra, MSCE, a fertility
                specialist at Penn Fertility Care, and Pam Kelberg, LCSW, a
                psychotherapist specializing in helping women and couples cope
                with infertility, about practicing self-care to boost your
                physical and emotional wellbeing during fertility treatments.
                Exercise Kindness “The first thing to remember, is to be kind to
                yourself,” Dr. Kalra said. “A lot of times people feel very
                isolated and put a lot of pressure on themselves. The one thing
                to continually try to focus on is that patients are doing
                everything right.” “Sometimes it seems like every time they turn
                around a friend or family member is celebrating a pregnancy,”
                she said, noting that she assures patients they aren’t alone –
                about 15 percent of couples experience infertility. “They think,
                ‘Wow, this is happening for everyone else but me.’” Kelberg
                agreed that practicing self-kindness is imperative. “It’s always
                important to be compassionate and gentle with oneself,” she
                said. “Don’t use language that’s judgmental or comparing
                yourself with another.” Find Happiness in Small Things To help
                ease the stress of fertility treatments, Dr. Kalra suggests
                doing one thing every day that makes you happy, but that one
                thing isn’t one-size-fits-all. “I don’t like to offer anything
                too prescriptive,” she said. “Some people might say ‘I hate
                yoga!’ So I don’t want them to do something that they despise.
                “A walk, a talk with a confidant or a family member, taking some
                time out to get yourself a massage, acupuncture … anything to
                help with your sense of wellbeing.” Take a Break But, Dr. Kalra
                said, don’t feel like you always have to be doing something. “I
                often tell patients that if it’s going to create more stress in
                your already overscheduled life, then just lie in bed and
                mediate at the end of the day,” she said. “Anything that keeps
                your tank full, makes you feel less depleted, and makes you feel
                that you aren’t alone.” Kelberg suggests also taking a break
                from fertility talk and even from some commitments, if possible.
                “I remind people to take an emotional break from talking about
                fertility,” Kelberg said. “And if couples feel like they need to
                scale back, they should allow themselves to scale back.” Scaling
                back could involve talking with a boss about the stress you are
                experiencing outside of the workplace. You don’t have to go into
                specifics — the amount of information you give your supervisor
                depends upon your comfort level. Perhaps he or she can help you
                arrange your schedule to attend medical appointments using time
                off, flex time or work from home opportunities to help alleviate
                your stress. Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help “I would definitely
                recommend to talk to your partner,” Kelberg said. “To talk about
                what it’s like, what you’re going through, what you’re feeling,
                what your worries might be … that may provide some relief.” And
                while frustration, anxiety, stress and sadness is normal during
                fertility treatments, it is recommended that you seek help if at
                any time those feelings become overwhelming. “Let your nurse
                know, let your physician know,” Dr. Kalra said. “We are always
                here to refer you if you think it’s helpful to speak to a
                psychologist or psychiatrist.” And, if you think your sadness is
                affecting your fertility treatments, Dr. Kalra says
                self-kindness is even more important.

                Endometriosis And Fertility: Three Reasons For Women To Have
                Hope
              </h1>
            </div>
            <div>
              <p>
                If you want to get pregnant and you’re diagnosed with
                endometriosis, you might assume that all hope is lost.
                Unfortunately, the common misconception that endometriosis and
                infertility go hand-in-hand has caused lots of women untold
                amounts of stress. But fortunately, there is plenty of good news
                about endometriosis and fertility, explains Divya Kelath Shah,
                MD, MME, a Penn Medicine physician and assistant professor of
                clinical obstetrics and gynecology. With the right treatment,
                you might get pregnant more easily than you think. Three Reasons
                Not to Panic About Endometriosis Below are three reasons why Dr.
                Shah says hopeful moms-to-be shouldn’t panic about
                endometriosis. Just because you have endometriosis doesn’t mean
                you’re infertile Endometriosis happens when the cells lining the
                uterus start to grow in places they shouldn’t, such as the
                ovaries or fallopian tubes. These growths can cause problems
                like blocking your fallopian tubes (the tubes where egg cells
                travel to the uterus), or forming scar tissue that makes it
                harder to get pregnant. But the problem varies for each woman.
                Some people might have extensive endometriosis; others might
                have just a few “spots” where the growths occur. “Endometriosis
                can prevent a woman from getting pregnant, but it certainly
                doesn’t have to,” Dr. Shah says. She says it is true that a
                greater proportion of women with endometriosis have difficulty
                getting pregnant. “But just because you have endometriosis, that
                doesn’t automatically mean you have infertility,” she says.
                There's no harm in trying to get pregnant on your own when you
                have endometriosis If you have been diagnosed with
                endometriosis, don’t assume you need to see a fertility
                specialist right away when you want to get pregnant. “I would
                never tell someone not to try to get pregnant on her own,” says
                Dr. Shah. “Many women are very successful with that approach.”
                “However, if a woman with endometriosis is not pregnant after
                six or seven months of trying on her own, we may ask her to come
                in for an infertility consult to see if the endometriosis is
                contributing to her difficulty getting pregnant,” she adds.
                “This is in contrast to the one-year timeframe that we would
                advise a typical low-risk woman to try before seeking fertility
                assistance.”

            <div><h1>What's the Link Between Obesity and Infertility?</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                For couples struggling with fertility, there’s an unlikely tool
                that could help—the scale. That’s right. Being overweight or
                obese can affect a couple’s ability to get pregnant. In fact,
                obesity is the cause of fertility struggles in six percent of
                women who have never been pregnant before, says the American
                Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM). Obesity affects
                infertility by changing the way a woman’s body stores sex
                hormones. Here’s how: Fat cells convert a male hormone known as
                androstenedione into a female hormone called estrone. Estrone
                affects the metabolism of the part of the brain that regulates
                ovarian and testicular function. This can impair reproductive
                function. And it’s not just the woman’s weight that affects
                fertility. Obese men are more likely to have low or nonexistent
                sperm counts, according to a March 2012 article in JAMA Internal
                Medicine. This happens for several reasons: Obesity can elevate
                body temperatures, especially around the scrotum. It can also
                lead to hormonal imbalances. Obese men are more likely to have
                higher estrogen levels, combined with lower levels of
                sperm-producing hormones like inhibin b and androgen. This can
                mess with sperm count, sperm concentration and the sperm’s
                ability to swim well, according to a March 2010 study in the
                journal Nature Reviews Urology. Making Fertility Issues Worse
                besity and infertility can have a weird, circular relationship
                as well. It’s hard to tell which one caused the other. For
                example, stress—like the kind couples experience during a long
                fertility journey—can not only cause irregular periods, but some
                women “stress eat,” meaning they binge on junk food during times
                of stress. Then, there are health conditions like polycystic
                ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder that can cause
                cysts on the ovaries. While the cause of PCOS is unknown, one
                side effect of PCOS is obesity. The National Infertility
                Association points out that obesity is common among PCOS
                patients, affecting 50 to 60 percent of women with this
                condition. The symptoms may be worse if a woman is obese. Take
                Charge of Your Health Sometimes addressing fertility challenges
                starts with getting to a healthy weight. Losing weight is a
                simple concept, but in practice, it’s not always easy. If
                changing your diet and exercising have not worked, you may want
                to talk to your doctor about bariatric surgery. It may be worth
                considering if you: Are more than 100 pounds above your ideal
                weight Have weight-related health issues, like high blood
                pressure or Type 2 diabetes Have tried weight loss programs, but
                nothing has worked Don’t have any current challenges with
                alcohol or drug abuse Think about it. If obesity is the
                underlying cause of your fertility challenges, it’s best to
                address that before starting or continuing fertility treatments.
                Talk to your doctor about how your body weight may be affecting
                your fertility.

            <div><h1>PCOS and Sleep Apnea</h1></div>
            <div>
              <p>
                Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex condition, or
                group of physical symptoms, in which women experience infrequent
                menstruation, weight gain, acne, abnormal hair growth and
                fertility problems. “Women with PCOS are at risk for other,
                related life-long conditions and symptoms including diabetes,
                high cholesterol, hypertension,” says Anuja Dokras, MD, PhD,
                director of the Penn Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Center. “They are
                also at risk for sleep apnea.” Sleep apnea is a respiratory
                disorder in which a person experiences pauses in breathing.
                Pauses can last from a few seconds to a minute, and can occur
                multiple times throughout the night. “Sleep apnea presents
                itself as snoring, pauses in breathing followed by a gasp for
                breath and frequent, disturbed sleep,” says Dr. Dokras. “A
                partner or spouse may tell the person with sleep apnea this is
                occurring, or in some cases, the person with sleep apnea wakes
                themselves up during the night.” Snoring itself isn’t serious,
                but if a person is experiencing snoring with sleep apnea, the
                situation can have serious complications. “For women with PCOS,
                sleep apnea can exacerbate other PCOS symptoms such as
                tiredness, difficulty losing weight, hypertension and insulin
                resistance,” says Dr. Dokras. “Of course, many women report
                feeling tired, but some also say they feel depressed and
                experience unexplained moodiness.” Diagnosing Sleep Apnea Allan
                Pack, MD, PhD, chief of the division of sleep medicine and
                director of the Center for Sleep and Circadian Neurobiology at
                Penn says sleep apnea often goes undiagnosed. “There are two
                different ways we can diagnose sleep apnea,” he explains. “A
                sleep study in a sleep lab that resembles a hotel room requires
                patients be hooked up to wires throughout the night. An
                electroencephalogram, or EEG, monitors brain activity throughout
                the night to determine how well an individual is sleeping, while
                patients are watched using respiratory monitors to see if there
                are pauses in their breathing as they sleep”. Dr. Pack explains
                “at-home” sleep studies are also an option for some patients.
                “For patients without a lot of other health conditions, an
                ‘at-home’ sleep study can monitor sleep, and pauses in
                breathing,” he says. “The only difference is that an EEG study
                is not done in the home.” Treatments for Women with PCOS and
                Sleep Apnea Treatment for PCOS includes medication, nutritional
                counseling and weight loss. “Weight loss can help improve sleep
                apnea, but treatment for sleep apnea itself can have a marked
                improvement on a woman’s life,” says Dr. Dokras. Dr. Pack says
                most patients can use a continuous positive airway pressure
                machine, or CPAP machine, to help regulate breathing throughout
                the night. “A CPAP machine uses a mask with pressurized air to
                force the airways in the mouth and neck to remain open while the
                person is lying down and asleep,” says Dr. Pack. “A CPAP machine
                is very effective. Patients who use it report having more energy
                throughout the day, and less drowsiness.” There is also a small
                amount of evidence that suggests use of a CPAP machine can help
                other metabolic functions in women with PCOS such as insulin
                resistance, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. For those
                who cannot tolerate wearing a CPAP mask throughout the night, an
                oral device that pulls the jaw forward may be an option for
                treatment. For those who cannot tolerate wearing a CPAP mask
                throughout the night, an oral device that pulls the jaw forward
                may be an option for treatment. "We are learning more and more
                that restful, healthy sleep is important for every other body
                function," says Dr. Dokras. "That's why it's so important women
                with PCOS talk to their physician about their sleep, and if they
                are experiencing any symptoms of sleep apnea."

                How Couples Struggling with Infertility Can Keep the Spark May

                There’s a reason diets are difficult. You have to switch from
                eating for pleasure to eating for a specific goal. That can make
                food unenjoyable. Cooking, a chore. For couples struggling with
                fertility, sex and romance can feel the same way, only more
                intense. Sex and romance can feel like an all-consuming,
                full-time job. “At least it’s fun trying, right?” Maybe not.
                Before, you and your partner probably had sex because you felt
                like it, because it was Saturday morning and raining. But now,
                depending on where you are in the fertility process, you might
                need to have sex at very specific times to increase your chances
                of getting pregnant—whether you’re in the mood or not. Here’s
                the reality: sex on a schedule isn’t always that sexy. During
                the fertility treatment process, sex can become simply a means
                to a baby—if you let it. You or your partner might be so focused
                on getting pregnant and the next steps in the fertility
                treatment process that the rest of your relationship—including
                romance—takes a backseat. And that can really strain your
                relationship. Fertility treatments can be taxing, emotionally
                and physically. There are days you’ll feel sick, sad, grumpy or
                just plan unsexy. But remember: Sex isn’t the only way to
                connect. Here are four ways to keep the flame from blowing out
                in your relationship during fertility treatments: Talk About
                Other Stuff You probably didn’t talk or stress about babies all
                day everyday before the fertility process. Perhaps when you
                first got together, you talked about the crazy people at your
                job, your next vacation or other things that make you
                interesting, complex people. Ideally, pick something that will
                get you both out of the baby conversation and back to seeing
                each other as complex people with other interests. Because guess
                what? You still are those interesting, complex people. Check in
                with each other on the other aspects of life. And that shouldn’t
                be pushed aside just because having a baby has become a
                priority. Remember the Beginning Remember what connected you in
                the first place. Try to get back there. Maybe when you and your
                partner first got together, he made you dinner, and it blew your
                mind that he was such a great cook—or such a terrible one. What
                did you and your partner like to do before you started fertility
                treatments? What was something that made you feel close? What
                was something your partner did that attracted you in the
                beginning? Relocate Save the scheduled sex for a specific
                location that lends itself to doing what you have to do and
                getting it done—like an unoccupied guest room. Then, have
                another spot—like the bedroom—for the real-deal sex, when you’re
                both feeling romantic and aroused and just want to enjoy it.
                This separation can remind both of you that there is a slice of
                your marriage that you will not allow to be taken over by the
                fertility process. It’s off limits, and it’s just for you two.
                Show Your Love Sometimes, there’s nothing sexier than a genuine
                compliment. Make an effort to give them and receive them with
                gusto. If your husband says, “You look really pretty today,”
                don’t come back with, “Ugh, I feel so gross.” Rub each other’s
                shoulders; leave each other love notes; plan fun dates. Then,
                remember to express appreciation for even the smallest romantic
                gesture. The positive side is that you and your partner are a
                team, working toward something together. During the fertility
                process, make sure to keep your romantic spark a priority, too.
                Besides, it’s not like romance will get any easier when you
                become parents.
